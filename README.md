# C++ implementation VRPTW with Greedy Algorithm
C++>11 required

## Problem description
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows(VRPTW) are briefly explained here(https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing/cvrp), (http://cognitive-robotics17.csail.mit.edu/docs/tutorials/Tutorial10_Multi_vehicle_Routing_with_Time_Windows.pdf).

## Usage
Run the following command

```make clean && make```

```./main.exe ./Probs/solomon_***/***.txt```

the second argument is text file path

## Reference
Public benchmark for VRPTW, [Solomon's problem sets](http://w.cba.neu.edu/~msolomon/problems.htm) is obtained from "data" directory in this [repo](https://github.com/DouYishun/vrp-espprc).
